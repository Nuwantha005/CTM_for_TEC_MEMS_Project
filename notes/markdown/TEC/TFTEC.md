From paper [2015_Performance-analysis-of-a-thermoelectric-cooler-with-a-corrugated-architecture](<file:///E:\Semester 7\ME4311 - MicroNano Electro Mechanical Systems and Nanotechnology\Project\Papers\2015_Performance-analysis-of-a-thermoelectric-cooler-with-a-corrugated-architecture.pdf>)

Devices such as shown in the figure can be used to my project purpose.
Classic TFTEC however, transfer heat in the vertical direction, and cannot be used for my application.

These are also known as planar thermoelectric coolers. The paper [Micro thermoelectric cooler - Planar multistage](<file:///E:\Semester 7\ME4311 - MicroNano Electro Mechanical Systems and Nanotechnology\Project\Papers\Micro thermoelectric cooler - Planar multistage.pdf>) describes an resistor based model for such system with 6 stages. Further Discussion on [[Micro thermoelectric cooler - Planar multistage]].


Thermal conductivity of the thin films are generally lower compared to bulk thermoelectirc legs while electrical resistivity is higher.
