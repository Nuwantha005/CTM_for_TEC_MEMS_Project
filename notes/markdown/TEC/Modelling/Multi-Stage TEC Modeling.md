Based on Paper [Thermoeconomic Analysis of Multi-Stage Thermoelectric Cooler](<file:///E:\Semester 7\ME4311 - MicroNano Electro Mechanical Systems and Nanotechnology\Project\Papers\gpt\Thermoeconomic Analysis of Multi-Stage Thermoelectric Cooler.pdf>). But this focuses on economics, so for full physical analysis refer [Exergy analysis of single stage and multi stage thermoelectric cooler.](<file:///E:\Semester 7\ME4311 - MicroNano Electro Mechanical Systems and Nanotechnology\Project\Papers\gpt\Exergy analysis of single stage and multi stage thermoelectric cooler..pdf>)

A single-stage TEC can be modeled by one-dimensional heat and charge transport. Each Peltier leg of n and p-type pairs (total N pairs) obeys steady-state energy balance,
$$Q_{c}=N\left[\alpha I T_{c}-\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}I^{2}R-K\left(T_{h}-T_{c}\right)\right],$$
$\alpha I T_c \rightarrow$ Peltier Cooling
$I^2 R/2 \rightarrow$ Joule Heating
$K(T_h-T_c)\rightarrow$ Back Conduction

This formula is critical when building the [[Resistor Network of TEC modules]] for the optimization processes. Three heating / cooling elements can be modeled as three resistors.

Refer [[TEC Physics]] to get relations for $K$ and $R$. Using this formula, we can write cooling power and heat rejection for each stage of the TEC, and this forms a set of equations we can solve when parameters are given.

You should note that, due to the radial nature of the proposed design, the parameters such as $A$ will not be constant and depends on the location of the TEC. This will give rise to the non-linear behavior. 




This is the most crucial part of the physics modeling. Let's break down exactly how the equations are formed, why we "equate" things, and how to handle the specific resistor locations. ### 1. The "Governing Equation" is simple Conservation of Energy You are confused because textbooks give you a formula for $Q_c$ and a formula for $Q_h$. * $Q_c$: Heat pumped **out** of a cold node. * $Q_h$: Heat dumped **into** a hot node. In a multi-stage or radial network, **Node $i$** acts as the bridge between two stages. It physically represents the **Copper Interconnect** that links the **Hot Side of Stage $(i-1)$** to the **Cold Side of Stage $i$**. Therefore, the Governing Equation for Node $i$ is **Energy Balance**: $$ \text{Heat Arriving} = \text{Heat Leaving} $$ $$ \underbrace{Q_{h, (i-1)}}_{\text{Heat Dumped by inner stage}} + \underbrace{Q_{TSV}}_{\text{Heat from Chip}} = \underbrace{Q_{c, i}}_{\text{Heat Sucked by outer stage}} $$ --- ### 2. Breaking down $Q_h$ and $Q_c$ To understand where the $1/2 I^2 R$ comes from, we look at the standard model terms: **Term 1: Heat Dumped by Previous Stage ($Q_{h, i-1}$)** The inner ring $(i-1)$ is pushing heat *into* this node. $$ Q_{h, i-1} = \underbrace{S_{i-1} I_{i-1} T_{node}}_{\text{Peltier Heat Dumped}} + \underbrace{K_{i-1}(T_{prev} - T_{node})}_{\text{Conduction from inner}} + \underbrace{Q_{Joule, Hot}}_{\text{Joule Heat}} $$ **Term 2: Heat Sucked by Current Stage ($Q_{c, i}$)** The outer ring $(i)$ is pulling heat *out* of this node. $$ Q_{c, i} = \underbrace{S_{i} I_{i} T_{node}}_{\text{Peltier Cooling}} - \underbrace{K_{i}(T_{node} - T_{next})}_{\text{Back-Conduction}} - \underbrace{Q_{Joule, Cold}}_{\text{Joule Heat}} $$ --- ### 3. The Joule Heating Problem ($I^2 R$) This is your specific question: *How do we split the resistance?* In the standard textbook formula ($0.5 I^2 R$), they assume the resistance is uniform inside the TEC leg. Heat generated in the middle of the leg flows 50% to the hot side and 50% to the cold side. **However, you have a detailed resistance model.** You have: 1. $R_{leg}$: The bulk semiconductor material. 2. $R_{interconnect}$: The copper bridge at the node. 3. $R_{contact}$: The solder/boundary resistance. #### Where does the heat go? * **Heat generated in $R_{interconnect}$:** This is physically **AT** the node. 100% of this heat stays at the node. * **Heat generated in $R_{contact}$:** This is physically **AT** the node surface. 100% of this heat stays at the node. * **Heat generated in $R_{leg}$:** This is distributed along the leg. ~50% flows to the node. #### The Correct Mathematical Formulation We must split the resistance terms in our equation based on physics. Let's define the Total Electrical Resistance of **Stage $i$** ($R_{el, i}$) as: $$ R_{el, i} = R_{leg, i} + R_{contact, hot} + R_{contact, cold} + R_{interconnect} $$ But for the Nodal Balance at **Node $i$** (which joins Stage $i-1$ Hot and Stage $i$ Cold), we sum the heat generation: **1. Heating from the Inner Stage ($i-1$) entering Node $i$:** The node is the "Hot Side" of stage $i-1$. $$ Q_{Joule, (i-1) \to Node} = \frac{1}{2} I_{i-1}^2 R_{leg, i-1} + I_{i-1}^2 R_{contact, hot} $$ **2. Heating from the Outer Stage ($i$) staying at Node $i$:** The node is the "Cold Side" of stage $i$. $$ Q_{Joule, Node \leftarrow i} = \frac{1}{2} I_{i}^2 R_{leg, i} + I_{i}^2 (R_{contact, cold} + R_{interconnect}) $$ *(Note: I included $R_{interconnect}$ here. Since the node IS the interconnect, any resistance inside it generates heat directly into the node).* --- ### 4. The Final Combined Equation Now we plug these specific Joule terms back into the Energy Balance ($Q_{h, i-1} + Q_{TSV} - Q_{c, i} = 0$). **The Master Equation for Node $i$:** $$ \underbrace{\left[ S_{i-1}I_{i-1}T_i + K_{i-1}(T_{i-1}-T_i) + \left( \frac{1}{2}R_{leg, i-1} + R_{cont,h} \right)I_{i-1}^2 \right]}_{\text{Heat Arriving from Inner Stage (Hot Side)}} + \underbrace{\frac{T_{Si,i} - T_i}{R_{v,i}}}_{\text{Heat from TSV}} - \underbrace{\left[ S_{i}I_{i}T_i - K_{i}(T_i-T_{i+1}) - \left( \frac{1}{2}R_{leg, i} + R_{cont,c} + R_{int} \right)I_{i}^2 \right]}_{\text{Heat Removed by Outer Stage (Cold Side)}} = 0 $$ *Note carefully the signs in the last bracket.* $Q_c$ is the **Net Cooling Capacity**. Net Cooling = (Peltier Power) - (Back Conduction) - (Joule Heat). So when we move $Q_c$ to the Right Hand Side, the Joule Heat term (which is negative in the capacity formula) effectively adds heat to the node. ### Summary for your Optimization Code: When building your matrix, the **Source Vector B** (the constants) for Node $i$ will contain the Joule Heating terms. $$ B_i = - \left[ I_{i-1}^2 \left( 0.5 R_{leg, i-1} + R_{cont,h} \right) + I_{i}^2 \left( 0.5 R_{leg, i} + R_{cont,c} + R_{int} \right) \right] $$ This accurately accounts for exactly where the heat is generated: 100% of the interconnect/contact heat goes into the node, and 50% of the leg heat goes into the node.
